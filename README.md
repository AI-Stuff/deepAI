# Detection of Accounting Anomalies using Deep Autoencoder Neural Networks 

A lab we prepared for NVIDIA's GPU Technology Conference 2018 that will walk you through the detection of accounting anomalies using deep autoencoder neural networks. The majority of the lab content is based on Jupyter Notebook, Python and PyTorch.
